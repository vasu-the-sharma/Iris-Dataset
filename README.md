# Iris-Dataset

Machine Learning model for iris dataset. 

Libraries used are: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn

Dataset used: Iris.csv

Machine Learning algorithms used are: SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN 

Highest accuracy is achieved using SVM algorithm. 

The accuracy of the KNN using Petals is: 0.97777777777777775

The accuracy of the SVM using Sepals is: 0.80000000000000004

Observations:
Using Petals over Sepal for training the data gives a much better accuracy.
This was expected as we saw in the heatmap above that the correlation between the Sepal Width and Length was very low whereas the correlation between Petal Width and Length was very high.
